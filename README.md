# Source code for my map of the primary domesticated animals of different societies

The python file I used to create my domesticated animal map.

All of the attributions, and the map itself, are available here: <https://brandonsvoid.com/mapping-primary-animals>

This file was created in Google Colaboratory. I've also tested it in a local Python environment, but not in a Jupyter notebook environment. However, I see no reason why it wouldn't work in any environment where you have the prerequisite packages and can run Python.
