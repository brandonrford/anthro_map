# anthro_map

The python file I used to create my domesticated animal map.

All of the attributions, and the map itself, are available here: [https://brandonsvoid.com/mapping-primary-animals/](https://brandonsvoid.com/mapping-primary-animals/)

This file was created in Google Colaboratory, and I can only verify that it works on there. However, I see no reason why it wouldn't work in a normal or Jupyter notebook.
